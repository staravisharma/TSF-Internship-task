What is "Covid Tracking Project"?
The following descriptions are collected directly from the project website.

"The COVID Tracking Project collects and publishes the most complete testing data available for US states and territories.

It has been cited in and used by major media companies and agencies.

The COVID Tracking Project exists because every person, newsroom, and government agency in the United States deserves access to the most complete picture of COVID-19 testing data that can be assembled.

Understanding the shape, speed, and location of regional outbreaks requires the entire testing picture: how many people have actually been tested in each state/territory, when they were tested, and what their results were. Thatâ€™s where their data comes in.

Because we have no complete official account of COVID-19 testing data in the US, we have to get this data from the public health authority in each US state and territory (and the District of Columbia). Each of these authorities reports its data in its own way, including online dashboards, data tables, PDFs, press conferences, tweets, and Facebook posts. And while many states and territories have slowly moved toward more standard ways of reporting, the actual categories of information are still in flux.

Our data team uses website-scrapers and trackers to alert us to changes, but the actual updates to our dataset are done manually by careful humans who double-check each change and extensively annotate changes areas of ambiguity. The work of data-gathering from official sources is also now supplemented by a fast-growing group of reporters who are constantly pushing authorities to release more comprehensive information."
